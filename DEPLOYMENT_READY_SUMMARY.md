# üöÄ READY TO DEPLOY: Business Photo Upload & WebSocket Logout Fixes

## ‚úÖ CURRENT STATUS
Both fixes are **implemented and ready for deployment**:

### 1. **Business Photo Upload Fix** 
- **Issue**: "Internal server error" when uploading business photos during registration
- **Fix**: Registration bypass implemented - uploads with `X-Registration-Upload: true` header skip authentication
- **Files**: `backend/functions/upload/image_upload_handler.js`, `frontend/lib/services/image_upload_service.dart`

### 2. **WebSocket Logout Cleanup Fix**
- **Issue**: Stale WebSocket connections remain after user logout
- **Fix**: Enhanced logout cleanup + local WebSocket service copy for auth handler
- **Files**: `backend/functions/auth/websocket_service.js`, `backend/functions/auth/unified_auth_handler.js`

## üîß TO DEPLOY THE FIXES

### Step 1: Configure AWS Credentials
Choose one method:

**Method A: AWS Configure**
```bash
aws configure
# Enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Key, region (us-east-1)
```

**Method B: Environment Variables**
```bash
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

### Step 2: Deploy
```bash
cd /Users/ghaythallaheebi/order-receiver-app-2
./deploy_fixes_complete.sh
```

### Step 3: Test
```bash
./test_deployed_fixes.sh
```

## üéØ EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER DEPLOYMENT

### ‚úÖ Business Photo Upload
- New account registration with business photos will work
- No more "internal server error" during registration
- Authenticated uploads still work normally

### ‚úÖ WebSocket Logout Cleanup  
- User logout will properly clean up WebSocket connections

   curl -X POST "https://zz9cszv6a8.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/upload" \
     -H "X-Registration-Upload: true" \
     -F "image=@test.jpg" \
     -F "uploadType=business-photo"
   # Should return 200 OK
   ```

2. **WebSocket Logout Test:**

3. **Flutter App Test:**
   - Try creating a new account with business photo
   - Should complete successfully without errors
