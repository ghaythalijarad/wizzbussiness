# Deployment Status - Local Development Environment

## üöÄ LOCAL DEVELOPMENT READY ‚úÖ

**Date:** June 29, 2025  
**Local Server URL:** <http://localhost:8000>  
**Status:** Backend running locally, Frontend build successful  

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- **Backend Implementation**
  - Created `SimpleNotificationService` with MongoDB persistence
  - Created `SimpleNotificationController` with RESTful endpoints
  - Updated `application.py` to include simplified system alongside existing one
  - Modified order services to send notifications through both systems

- **Local Development**
  - Successfully configured local development environment
  - Removed cloud deployment dependencies
  - App successfully starts and serves HTTP requests locally
  - Health endpoints working correctly

- **API Documentation**
  - FastAPI automatic documentation available at `/docs`
  - Health check endpoint working: `/health`
  - Detailed health endpoint available: `/health/detailed`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Issues

- **MongoDB Connection**
  - TLS handshake issues with MongoDB Atlas
  - App continues to run without database (graceful degradation)
  - Need to resolve MongoDB Atlas TLS compatibility

- **Order Simulation Service**
  - OrderSimulationService temporarily disabled due to import issues
  - Frontend build successful with simulation features commented out
  - Need to fix import path issues to re-enable simulation functionality

- **Testing and Integration**
  - Complete testing of notification endpoints with database
  - End-to-end testing of notification flow

## Working Endpoints (Local)

- **Root:** <http://localhost:8000>
- **Health:** <http://localhost:8000/health>
- **Detailed Health:** <http://localhost:8000/health/detailed>
- **API Docs:** <http://localhost:8000/docs>

## Key Achievements

1. **Local Development Success** - Backend running locally on port 8000
2. **Flutter Build Success** - Frontend builds without errors
3. **Graceful Database Fallback** - App continues to work without MongoDB
4. **Health Monitoring** - Comprehensive health checks implemented
5. **API Documentation** - Interactive documentation available
6. **Cloud Cleanup** - Removed all cloud deployment files and configurations

## Next Steps

1. **Fix MongoDB TLS Issue** - Resolve SSL handshake problems
2. **Re-enable Order Simulation** - Fix import issues with OrderSimulationService
3. **Test Notification System** - Verify all endpoints work with database
4. **Frontend Integration** - Update Flutter app to use new endpoints
5. **Production Testing** - End-to-end notification flow testing

## Technical Notes

- App uses graceful startup that continues without database connection
- Environment variable `USE_SIMPLIFIED_NOTIFICATIONS=true` is set
- All dependencies correctly installed for local development
- Python 3.11.6 runtime working correctly
