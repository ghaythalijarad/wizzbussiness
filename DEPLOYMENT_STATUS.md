**Heroku App URL:** <https://wizz-9fa6547f0499.herokuapp.com/>  
**Status:** App running successfully  

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- **Backend Implementation**
  - Created `SimpleNotificationService` with MongoDB persistence
  - Created `SimpleNotificationController` with RESTful endpoints
  - Updated `application.py` to include simplified system alongside existing one
  - Modified order services to send notifications through both systems

- **Heroku Deployment**
  - Successfully configured Heroku app "wizz"
  - Fixed missing `aiohttp` dependency
  - Configured environment variables for Heroku deployment
  - App successfully starts and serves HTTP requests
  - Health endpoints working correctly

- **API Documentation**
  - FastAPI automatic documentation available at `/docs`
  - Health check endpoint working: `/health`
  - Detailed health endpoint available: `/health/detailed`

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Pending Issues

- **MongoDB Connection on Heroku**
  - TLS handshake fails on Heroku (SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_INTERNAL_ERROR)
  - App continues to run without database (graceful degradation)
  - Need to resolve MongoDB Atlas TLS compatibility with Heroku

- **Testing and Integration**
  - Complete testing of notification endpoints with database
  - Frontend integration with Flutter app
  - End-to-end testing of notification flow

## Working Endpoints

- **Root:** <https://wizz-9fa6547f0499.herokuapp.com/>
- **Health:** <https://wizz-9fa6547f0499.herokuapp.com/health>
- **Detailed Health:** <https://wizz-9fa6547f0499.herokuapp.com/health/detailed>
- **API Docs:** <https://wizz-9fa6547f0499.herokuapp.com/docs>

## Key Achievements

1. **Heroku Deployment Success** - App is running and serving requests
2. **Graceful Database Fallback** - App continues to work without MongoDB
3. **Health Monitoring** - Comprehensive health checks implemented
4. **API Documentation** - Interactive documentation available
5. **Environment Configuration** - All necessary environment variables set

## Next Steps

1. **Fix MongoDB TLS Issue** - Resolve SSL handshake problems on Heroku
2. **Test Notification System** - Verify all endpoints work with database
3. **Frontend Integration** - Update Flutter app to use new endpoints
4. **Production Testing** - End-to-end notification flow testing

## Technical Notes

- App uses graceful startup that continues without database connection
- Environment variable `USE_SIMPLIFIED_NOTIFICATIONS=true` is set
- All dependencies correctly installed on Heroku
- Python 3.11.6 runtime working correctly
