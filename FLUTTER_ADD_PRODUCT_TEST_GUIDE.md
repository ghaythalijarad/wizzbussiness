   - "Inventory" or "Menu Management"
   - Floating Action Button (+ icon)
3. **Tap "Add Product"** or similar button

### **Step 3: Fill Product Form**

## 🔍 **WHAT TO LOOK FOR**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**

## 🐛 **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **If you get "Unauthorized" errors:**

1. **Check authentication:** Logout and login again
2. **Verify business status:** Ensure business is approved
3. **Check console logs** for detailed error messages

### **If form validation fails:**

1. **Ensure all required fields are filled:**
   - Name (required)
   - Description (required)
   - Price (required, must be > 0)
   - Category (required)
2. **Check price format:** Use numbers only, decimals allowed

### **If backend errors occur:**

1. **Check network connectivity**
2. **Verify API endpoint is accessible**
3. **Look for detailed error messages in app logs**

## 📊 **VERIFICATION STEPS**

After adding a product:

1. **Navigate to Products List** (if not automatically shown)
2. **Verify your new product appears** with correct details
3. **Try editing the product** to ensure it's properly stored
4. **Check if product has a unique ID** assigned

---

## 🎯 **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

If everything works correctly:

- ✅ Product form submits successfully  
- ✅ Success message displays
- ✅ Product appears in products list
- ✅ Product has proper ID and details stored

This confirms the add product endpoint is working end-to-end!

## 🚀 **READY TO TEST!**

The Flutter app should now be running on the iOS Simulator. Follow the steps above to test the add product functionality.

**Remember:** The backend endpoint is confirmed working - any issues are likely with form validation, authentication, or UI navigation.
