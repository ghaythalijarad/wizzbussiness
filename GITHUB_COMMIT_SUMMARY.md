**Branch**: `dev`  
**Commit Hash**: `c3a94b0a`

## 🚀 Successfully Committed to GitHub

### 📋 Changes Committed:
- **Search Functionality Fix**: Resolved product management search bar error
- **Product Provider Update**: Modified `frontend/lib/providers/product_provider.dart`
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive progress and technical docs
- **Testing Scripts**: Included validation and testing utilities

### 🎯 Main Achievement:
**Fixed the "failed to load products" error when searching in product management page**

#### Root Cause:
- Search was using separate `/products/search` API endpoint with authentication issues
- Main product loading worked fine, but search API calls failed

- Implemented **local client-side filtering** instead of API-based search
- Now filters existing product data by name and description
- Eliminates dependency on problematic backend search endpoint
