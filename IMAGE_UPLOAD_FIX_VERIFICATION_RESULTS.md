## ðŸ”§ What Was Fixed

### Frontend (Flutter) Fixes:
- âœ… Added proper `http_parser` import for MediaType handling
- âœ… Fixed file extension detection from original file paths
- âœ… Added proper `contentType: MediaType.parse(mimeType)` to all uploads
- âœ… Updated both `uploadBusinessPhoto()` and `uploadProductImage()` methods

### Backend (Node.js) Fixes:
- âœ… Enhanced content-type normalization logic
- âœ… Improved file extension detection based on MIME types
- âœ… Fixed multipart form handling to preserve MIME types
- âœ… Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### Key Improvements:
1. **MIME Type Preservation**: Images now save with correct content-types instead of `application/octet-stream`
2. **File Extension Accuracy**: Extensions now match actual image format (PNG vs JPG)
3. **S3 Storage**: Real S3 URLs generated with proper bucket configuration
4. **Cross-platform Support**: Works for both Flutter mobile and web uploads

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Resolved

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Content-Type | `application/octet-stream` | `image/png` or `image/jpeg` |
| File Extensions | Hard-coded `.jpg` | Proper `.png` or `.jpg` based on format |
| S3 Storage | Mock URLs | Real S3 URLs with public access |
| MIME Handling | Flutter not setting contentType | Proper MediaType.parse() usage |

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The image upload system is now fully functional with:
- âœ… Correct MIME types preserved in S3
- âœ… Proper file extensions based on actual image format
- âœ… Real S3 storage with public accessibility
- âœ… Both business photos and product images working

**Recommendation**: The image upload fixes are production-ready and can be used in the Flutter app without further changes.
