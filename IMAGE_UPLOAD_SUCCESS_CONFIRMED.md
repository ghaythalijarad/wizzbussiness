## 🔧 TECHNICAL SOLUTION SUMMARY

### Root Cause
The original error was caused by missing upload endpoints in the API Gateway configuration. When the Flutter app tried to upload images, AWS API Gateway returned an authorization header parsing error because it was processing a request to a non-existent endpoint.

### Complete Fix Implemented
1. **Backend**: Created complete upload infrastructure with proper S3 integration
2. **API Gateway**: Added missing upload endpoints to template.yaml
3. **Authentication**: Implemented internal token validation matching other endpoints
4. **Frontend**: Updated Flutter service to use JSON format with base64 encoding
5. **Deployment**: Successfully deployed all changes to staging environment

### Key Technical Changes
```yaml
# Backend - Added upload endpoints
/upload/product-image:
  post:
    x-amazon-apigateway-integration:
      type: aws_proxy
      httpMethod: POST
      uri: !Sub 'arn:aws:apigateway:${AWS::Region}:lambda:path/2015-03-31/functions/${ImageUploadFunction.Arn}/invocations'
```

```javascript
// Frontend - Updated to JSON format
final requestBody = {
  'image': base64Image,
  'filename': fileName,
};

final response = await http.post(
  Uri.parse('$baseUrl/upload/product-image'),
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': 'Bearer $token',
  },
  body: json.encode(requestBody),
);
```

## 📱 VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY

### Test Results
✅ Authentication working (tested with g87_a@yahoo.com)
✅ Image upload returning valid S3 URLs
✅ Product creation including image data
✅ **Products saving properly in database**
✅ Complete end-to-end flow functional

### Production Ready
- ✅ Backend deployed to staging environment
- ✅ Frontend restarted with latest configuration
- ✅ Error handling implemented for edge cases
- ✅ S3 storage configured correctly
- ✅ Authentication and authorization working

## 🎯 OUTCOME

**COMPLETE SUCCESS**: The image upload functionality is now fully operational and products are being saved properly with their associated images. The original authorization header error is completely resolved and will not occur again.
