echo "🔧 LOCATION SETTINGS AUTHORIZATION FIX - VALIDATION"
echo "===================================================="

echo ""
echo "✅ COMPLETED STEPS:"
echo "1. Enhanced TokenManager deployed with ID token priority"
echo "2. AppAuthService updated to store both access and ID tokens"
echo "3. AuthHeaderBuilder automatically uses new TokenManager"
echo ""

echo "🎯 THE FIX:"
echo "- Problem: Access tokens missing 'aud' field for API Gateway"
echo "- Solution: Use ID tokens (which have 'aud' field) for authorization"
echo "- Implementation: TokenManager now prioritizes ID tokens over access tokens"
echo ""

echo "🧪 TO TEST THE FIX:"
echo "1. Open the running Flutter app"
echo "2. Sign out completely (to clear old tokens)"
echo "3. Sign in again (to get both access and ID tokens)"
echo "4. Go to Location Settings"
echo "5. Try to save location settings"
echo ""

echo "📝 EXPECTED CONSOLE LOGS:"
echo "During sign-in:"
echo "  💾 Storing access token (length: XXXX)"
echo "  💾 Storing ID token (length: XXXX)"
echo ""
echo "During location settings save:"
echo "  🎫 [TokenManager] Using ID token for authorization (length: XXXX)"
echo ""

echo "✅ SUCCESS CRITERIA:"
echo "- Location settings save without 401 Unauthorized error"
echo "- Console shows ID token being used for authorization"
echo ""

echo "🚨 IF STILL FAILING:"
echo "- Check if sign-in is storing both tokens"
echo "- Verify ID token contains 'aud' field"
echo "- Ensure API Gateway accepts ID tokens"
