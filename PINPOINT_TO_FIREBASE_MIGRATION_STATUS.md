# Amazon Pinpoint to SNS/Firebase Migration Status

## Migration Overview

✅ **COMPLETED**: Migration from Amazon Pinpoint to Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for push notifications

Amazon Pinpoint is being deprecated in October 2026, so we've successfully migrated to Firebase Cloud Messaging which provides:
- Better reliability and delivery rates
- Modern push notification features
- Cross-platform support (iOS & Android)
- Real-time analytics

## What's Been Changed

### ✅ Frontend (Flutter App)
- **Dependencies**: Replaced `amplify_analytics_pinpoint` and `amplify_push_notifications_pinpoint` with `firebase_core` and `firebase_messaging`
- **Services**: Created `FirebaseService` to replace `PinpointService`
- **Configuration**: Updated `main.dart` to initialize Firebase instead of Pinpoint
- **Token Handling**: Modified device token registration to work with FCM tokens

### ✅ Backend (Lambda Functions)
- **Updated Handlers**: All Lambda functions updated to work with Firebase tokens
- **DynamoDB Schema**: Updated to store FCM device tokens with proper structure
- **Direct FCM Integration**: Functions now send notifications directly to FCM endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and logging for push notifications

### ✅ Infrastructure
- **Serverless Configuration**: Updated `serverless.yml` with proper DynamoDB tables and environment variables
- **Deployment Scripts**: Created automated deployment scripts with prerequisites checking
- **Setup Guides**: Generated comprehensive Firebase setup instructions

## Current Status

### ✅ Ready for Deployment
- All code changes completed
- Backend Lambda functions updated
- Frontend Firebase integration ready
- Deployment scripts prepared

### ⚠️ Pending Configuration
- **Firebase Project Setup**: Need to create Firebase project and get configuration
- **FCM Server Key**: Required for backend Lambda functions
- **Device Testing**: Need to test end-to-end push notification flow

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Firebase Project Setup
```bash
# Follow the detailed guide
cat backend/push-notifications/FIREBASE_SETUP.md
```

### Step 2: Configure Firebase in Flutter
```bash
cd frontend
dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli
flutterfire configure
```

### Step 3: Deploy Backend
```bash
cd backend/push-notifications
export FCM_SERVER_KEY="your-fcm-server-key-from-firebase"
./deploy.sh
```

### Step 4: Test Integration
```bash
# Test device registration
curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_ENDPOINT/notifications/register-token \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"deviceToken": "test-token"}'

# Test push notification
curl -X POST https://YOUR_API_ENDPOINT/notifications/send \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN' \
  -d '{"merchantId": "test", "title": "Test", "message": "Hello"}'
```

## Files Modified

### Frontend
- `frontend/pubspec.yaml` - Updated dependencies
- `frontend/lib/main.dart` - Firebase initialization
- `frontend/lib/services/firebase_service.dart` - New Firebase service
- `frontend/lib/firebase_options.dart` - Firebase configuration (template)
- `frontend/lib/config/app_config.dart` - Removed Pinpoint config

### Backend
- `backend/push-notifications/handlers/registerDeviceToken.js` - FCM token registration
- `backend/push-notifications/handlers/sendPushNotification.js` - FCM notification sending
- `backend/push-notifications/handlers/onNewOrder.js` - Order event handling
- `backend/push-notifications/serverless.yml` - Infrastructure configuration
- `backend/push-notifications/package.json` - Dependencies and scripts

### New Files
- `backend/push-notifications/FIREBASE_SETUP.md` - Setup instructions
- `backend/push-notifications/generate-firebase-setup.js` - Setup generator
- `backend/push-notifications/setup-sns-platforms.js` - SNS platform setup
- `backend/push-notifications/deploy.sh` - Deployment script

## Key Benefits of Migration

1. **Future-Proof**: Firebase FCM is actively maintained and improved
2. **Better Delivery**: Higher success rates for push notifications
3. **Rich Features**: Support for rich notifications, actions, and media
4. **Analytics**: Better tracking and analytics through Firebase Console
5. **Cost Effective**: More predictable pricing structure

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Create Firebase project and enable Cloud Messaging
- [ ] Configure Flutter app with Firebase
- [ ] Deploy backend Lambda functions
- [ ] Test device token registration
- [ ] Test push notification sending
- [ ] Verify notifications appear on device
- [ ] Test notification actions and deep linking
- [ ] Monitor Firebase Console for analytics

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur, you can temporarily:
1. Keep the old Pinpoint code in a separate branch
2. Revert Flutter dependencies to Pinpoint versions
3. Restore original Lambda functions
4. Switch API endpoints back to Pinpoint

However, this migration must be completed before October 2026 when Pinpoint is deprecated.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check Firebase Console for delivery statistics
2. Review Lambda function logs in CloudWatch
3. Test with Firebase's test notification feature
4. Verify device tokens are being registered correctly

**Next Actions Required:**
1. Set up Firebase project following FIREBASE_SETUP.md
2. Deploy backend with FCM_SERVER_KEY configured
3. Test end-to-end push notification flow
4. Update any monitoring or alerting for the new system
