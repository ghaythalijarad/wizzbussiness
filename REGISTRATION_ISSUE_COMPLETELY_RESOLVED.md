# 🎉 REGISTRATION ISSUE COMPLETELY RESOLVED

## ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED AND TESTED

### 📧 Email Verification Success
- **Issue**: Verification codes were being sent via SMS instead of email
- **Root Cause**: Cognito User Pool had both email and phone_number as auto-verified attributes
- **Solution**: Updated Cognito configuration to use email-only verification
- **Result**: ✅ Email verification codes now sent successfully to user's email

### 🖼️ Business Photo Upload Authorization Fixed
- **Issue**: "unauthorized or invalid missing token" error during registration
- **Root Cause**: Business photo upload required authentication during registration
- **Solution**: Implemented registration upload bypass with X-Registration-Upload header
- **Result**: ✅ Business photos can be uploaded during registration without authentication

### 👤 Cognito User Creation Fixed
- **Issue**: Registration failed with "name.formatted" error
- **Root Cause**: Missing 'name' attribute in Cognito UserAttributes
- **Solution**: Added `{ Name: 'name', Value: \`${firstName} ${lastName}\` }` to registration
- **Result**: ✅ Users are created successfully in Cognito

### 📱 Frontend Null Check Crashes Fixed
- **Issue**: App crashed when clicking Register button
- **Root Cause**: Null pointer exceptions on `_formKey.currentState!`
- **Solution**: Added proper null checks and validation throughout registration flow
- **Result**: ✅ App handles all edge cases gracefully with clear error messages
