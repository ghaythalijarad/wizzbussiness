# Unified Order Status System Implementation

## Overview

The order status system has been unified across the business app to match the customer app's expectations. This ensures consistency between both applications.

## Unified Order Status Values

### Status Flow

```
pending → confirmed → preparing → ready → on_the_way → delivered
              ↓
           cancelled
```

### Status Definitions

1. **pending** (قيد الانتظار)
   - Initial state when order is received
   - Business can accept or reject the order

2. **confirmed** (مؤكد)
   - Order has been accepted by the business
   - Business can start preparing

3. **preparing** (قيد التحضير)
   - Order is being prepared
   - Business can mark as ready when done

4. **ready** (جاهز)
   - Order is ready for pickup/delivery
   - Can move to on_the_way

5. **on_the_way** (في الطريق)
   - Order is out for delivery
   - Can be marked as delivered

6. **delivered** (تم التوصيل)
   - Order has been successfully delivered
   - Final successful state

7. **cancelled** (ملغي)
   - Order was cancelled
   - Final unsuccessful state

8. **returned** (مُرجع)
   - Order was returned after delivery
   - Used for refunds/issues

9. **expired** (منتهي الصلاحية)
   - Order expired without being processed
   - System-generated status

## Implementation Changes

### 1. OrderStatus Enum Updated

- Replaced `pickedUp` with `delivered`
- Added `onTheWay` status
- Added `preparing` status

### 2. Status Parsing (Order.fromJson)

- Maps backend status strings to enum values
- Handles legacy `picked_up` → `delivered` mapping
- Supports various status string formats

### 3. UI Components Updated

- **OrderCard**: Progressive action buttons based on current status
- **OrdersPage**: Updated filter chips to include all statuses
- **Analytics**: Updated status colors and labels

### 4. Localization Added

- English and Arabic translations for all statuses
- Both short and long form labels (orderStatus prefix)

### 5. Backend Communication

- OrderService converts enum values to backend-expected strings
- Handles status mapping in both directions

## Action Flow in UI

### Pending Orders

- Show "Reject" and "Accept" buttons
- Accept → moves to confirmed status

### Confirmed Orders  

- Show "Start Preparing" button
- Preparing → moves to preparing status

### Preparing Orders

- Show "Mark Ready" button
- Ready → moves to ready status

### Ready Orders

- Show "Out for Delivery" button
- On the Way → moves to on_the_way status

### On the Way Orders

- Show "Mark Delivered" button
- Delivered → moves to delivered status

## Files Modified

### Core Models

- `lib/models/order.dart` - Updated enum and parsing logic

### UI Components

- `lib/widgets/order_card.dart` - Progressive action buttons
- `lib/screens/orders_page.dart` - Filter chips and status handling
- `lib/screens/analytics_page.dart` - Status colors and labels
- `lib/screens/orders_preview_page.dart` - Sample data updates

### Services

- `lib/services/order_service.dart` - Backend status mapping

### Utilities

- `lib/utils/return_order_utils.dart` - Updated return conditions

### Localization

- `lib/l10n/app_en.arb` - English status labels
- `lib/l10n/app_ar.arb` - Arabic status labels

## Backend Compatibility

The system maintains backward compatibility while supporting the new unified status flow:

```javascript
// Backend status mapping
{
  "pending": "قيد الانتظار",
  "confirmed": "مؤكد", 
  "preparing": "قيد التحضير",
  "ready": "جاهز",
  "on_the_way": "في الطريق",
  "delivered": "تم التوصيل"
}
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Status Transitions**: Test each status transition in the UI
2. **Backend Sync**: Verify status updates sync with backend
3. **Localization**: Test both English and Arabic labels
4. **Filter Functionality**: Ensure all status filters work correctly
5. **Legacy Data**: Test with existing orders that may have old status values

## Benefits

- ✅ Unified experience between customer and business apps
- ✅ Clear status progression for better order tracking
- ✅ Bilingual support for Arabic/English markets
- ✅ Backward compatibility with existing data
- ✅ Progressive UI that guides business users through order fulfillment

This implementation ensures the business app now matches the customer app's order status expectations while providing a smooth user experience for order management.
