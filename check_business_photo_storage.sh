echo "üîç WAYS TO VERIFY BUSINESS PHOTO STORAGE:"
echo ""

echo "1. üìä CHECK DYNAMODB RECORDS:"
echo "   aws dynamodb scan \\"
echo "     --table-name order-receiver-businesses-dev \\"
echo "     --region eu-north-1 \\"
echo "     --projection-expression 'businessId, business_name, business_photo_url' \\"
echo "     --output table"

echo "2. üîç CHECK SPECIFIC BUSINESS:"
echo "   aws dynamodb get-item \\"
echo "     --table-name order-receiver-businesses-dev \\"
echo "     --region eu-north-1 \\"
echo "     --key '{\"businessId\":{\"S\":\"YOUR_BUSINESS_ID\"}}' \\"
echo "     --projection-expression 'business_photo_url'"
echo ""

echo "3. üìù CHECK S3 BUCKETS (Currently none for images):"
echo "   aws s3 ls --region eu-north-1"
echo ""

echo "4. üåê TEST PHOTO URL ACCESSIBILITY:"
echo "   curl -I 'https://mock-s3-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/business-photos/test-id.jpg'"
echo "   Expected: 404 Not Found (since it's a mock URL)"
echo ""

echo "üìã IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:"
echo "   ‚úÖ Create S3 bucket for image storage"
echo "   ‚úÖ Update image_upload_handler.js to use real S3"
echo "   ‚úÖ Add S3 permissions to Lambda role"
echo "   ‚úÖ Configure proper image processing"
echo ""

echo "üîó CURRENT ENDPOINTS:"
echo "   POST /upload/business-photo - For registration uploads"
echo "   POST /upload/product-image - For authenticated uploads"
echo ""

echo "‚öôÔ∏è  TO ENABLE REAL S3 STORAGE:"
echo "   1. Add S3 bucket to serverless.yml"
echo "   2. Update Lambda permissions for S3"
echo "   3. Modify image_upload_handler.js"
echo "   4. Add proper error handling"
