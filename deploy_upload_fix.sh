    echo "   # Enter your AWS Access Key ID"
    echo "   # Enter your AWS Secret Access Key"
    echo "   # Region: us-east-1"
    echo "   # Output format: json"
    exit 1
fi

echo "✅ AWS credentials are valid"

echo "2. Build backend with upload fix:"
cd /Users/ghaythallaheebi/order-receiver-app-2/backend
sam build

if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
    echo "❌ Backend build failed"
    exit 1
fi
